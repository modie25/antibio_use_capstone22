Visit Timing on the Prediction of Antibiotic Utilization Patterns in Ambulatory Care. For Brown School MPH capstone '22

Main data is downloaded from the CDC's NAMCS datasets (https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/dataset_documentation/namcs/spss/).
Classification of antibiotics type is according to WHO-EMP-IAU-2019.11-eng.xlsx

**Results-**
Those who had a visit duration longer than 45 minutes exhibited 83% lower odds of being prescribed a “watch” level antibiotic
compared to those who had a visit less than 15 minutes. (OR= 0.17, 95% CI 0.045, 0.54). 
Visits regarding surgeries had higher odds of being prescribed a “watch” level antibiotic compared to those visiting for chronic concerns 
(OR=1.12, 95% CI 0.73,1.74). The amount of antibiotics prescribed between 2012 and 2016 trended downward. 
The time-series model demonstrated a seasonal pattern with significant parameters. 
**Conclusions-**
Visit duration should be included in antibiotic stewardship guidelines to properly assess the quality of visits 
resulting in an antibiotic prescription of varying resistance threat. Yearly antibiotic use has generally decreased and exhibits 
seasonal peaks towards the end of the year. However, additional filtering should be performed to predict future use most accurately
